1. What is RDD?
	RDDs are a primary abstraction in Spark. They are an immutable and fault tolerant collection of objects distributed 
	across nodes in a cluster and data operations are performed in them. There are two types of RDD opeations namely transformations and actions.

2. Define Partitions.
	The main abstraction in Spark is the Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD).Under the hood, these objects are stored in partitions. 
	When performing computations on RDDs, these partitions can be operated on in parallel.
	
3. What operations does RDD support?
	RDD supports two operations Transformations and actions
4. What do you understand by Transformations in Spark?
	Transformations are lazy operations on a RDD that create one or many new RDDs, e.g. map , filter , reduceByKey , join , cogroup , randomSplit.
    In other words, transformations are functions that take a RDD as the input and produce one or many RDDs as the output.
5. Define Actions
	Actions are RDD operations that produce non-RDD values. They materialize a value in a Spark program. 
	In other words, a RDD operation that returns a value of any type but RDD[T] is an action.
